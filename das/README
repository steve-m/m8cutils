Overview
--------

m8cdas is a non-symbolic disassembler for the M8C instruction set.
It disassembles one instruction at a time and does not attempt to
separate code from non-code.

Its main use is for having a quick look at a piece of binary data,
and for testing.


Usage
-----

m8cdas reads raw binary, ROM, and Intel HEX files either from a
file or from standard input. The special file name "-" is a synonym
for standard input. Format auto-detection can be overridden with
the option -b, for "binary".

Alternatively, a sequence of hex bytes can be passed on the command
line after the option -e.

m8cdas disassembles the byte sequence, assuming that the first byte
it at address 0. This address can be changed with the option -p.

An output line contains usually the address, the bytes making up the
instruction, and the decoded instruction. With the option -s, only
the decoded instruction is printed. With the option -t, the
instruction timing (in CPU cycles) is printed before the decoded
instruction.

If a symbol file is loaded with the option -m, symbolic names will
be used in the disassembled code.

Example:

% m8cdas prog.hex

Disassembles the content of prog.hex.
