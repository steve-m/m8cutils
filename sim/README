Overview
--------

The simulator loads a program in ROM, binary, or Intel Hex format, and executes
it in the simulation environment. The simulator currently only simulates the
CPU core, without interrupt handling, and GPIO pins. It currently does not
attempt to relate simulation time to real time.

The simulation is controlled by a simple script that can set and query memory
and registers, and that controls code execution. The simulator is not designed
to be interactive, but it is possible to enter the script during the simulation
run.


Usage
-----

The script is by default read from standard input. This can be changed with the
option -f. The script is passed through the C preprocessor. The usual CPP
options -I, -D, and -U are recognized and passed on. Normally, register
definitions are automatically included from the file default.mc8sim. This can
be turned off with the option -n. To disable CPP entirely, put -n twice.

The name of the chip is a mandatory command-line argument. The list of
supported chips can be obtained with the option -l.

The program file can be in ROM format, Intel Hex, or it can a raw binary.
Binary mode can be forced with the option -b. If the program file name argument
is omitted, the program is read from standard input. Note that standard input
can only provide either the script or the program, but not both.

The use of a DIY ICE is discussed below.


The DIY ICE
-----------

The simulator can connect to a target system and remotely control its
processor. Selected I/O operations can then be executed on the real hardware.
Use of an ICE is enabled with the option -i. Note that this only initializes
communication with the target but does not change it's I/O. To do this, I/O
lines must be assigned to the ICE with the "connect" directive in the
simulation script.

The simulator uses the regular ISSP(tm) interface for communication. It
delegates communication to the m8cprog programmer. The options "-p port",
"-d driver", -3, and -5 are used in exactly the same way as with m8cprog.


Scripting language
------------------

Each expression or command ends with a newline. Comments in the scripting
language are the usual forms known from C, and the semicolon from m8cas.

- if an expression is entered, it is calculated and its result is printed in
  hex and decimal. Example:

  (input)	5
  (output)	0x5 5

- constants can be numbers in any of the formats recognized by the M8C
  assembler language, including characters.

- Read from RAM, ROM, or a register:

  [address]
  RAM[address]
  ROM[address]
  REG[address]
  A
  F
  SP
  X
  .

  The names of CPU registers and the memory type prefixes are case-insensitive.
  Register and RAM addresses span the entire address range and are not affected
  by the current I/O bank or RAM page.

- Expressions from constants and read accesses can be formed using all
  operators recognized by m8cas. Additionally, the following operators are
  available:

  &ram[expression]	yields  expression
  expression[n]		yields the n-th bit of "expression", i.e., 0 or 1
  expression[l:r]	yields bits l through r of "expression", e.g.,
			0xd6[4:2] yields 5

  The precedence of & and [...] is like in C. Expressions are always calculated
  as unsigned 32 bit integers.

- Assign to RAM or a register. The target name is like when reading, e.g.,

  A = 0
  [0x100] = 1

- Run the program until an exception occurs or until a number of cycles has
  passed:

  run
  run CYCLES

  The current time in cycles can be obtained through the read-only variable @.
  To run the program for a N cycles, use "run @+N"

  Note: currently, one instruction is one cycle. This will change in the
  future.

- Connect I/O pins to an ICE, by port, pin, or pin range, e.g.,

  connect P2
  connect P0[0]
  connect P1[6:3]

  Writes to these pins are now propagated to the ICE, and reads of the pins use
  data obtained from the ICE. This applies to accesses from the program being
  simulated and for register accesss from the script.

  The pins used to communicate with the ICE, usually P1[0] and P1[1], cannot be
  connected. Port names are case-insensitive, so P1 is equal to p1.

- Disconnect I/O pins from the ICE, either all of them, or by port, pin, or pin
  range:

  disconnect
  disconnect P1
  disconnect P0[7]
  disconnect P5[6:0]

  Disconnected pins are turned into the Z state.

- Definitions of registers and fields of CY8C2xxxx chips are available as
  case-sensitive #defines.

  Register and field names follow the names in the TRM. Field names are
  constructed by appending the field name to the register name. Spaces in names
  are removed if the adjacent characters are non-numeric or differ in case.
  Otherwise, the spaces are replaced with underscores. Examples:

  "Page Bits" in IDX_PP becomes IDX_PP_PageBits
  "ECO EX" in CPU_SCR1 becomes CPU_SCR1_ECO_EX

  Registers are defined as accesses, e.g., PRT0DM0 is reg[0x100]. Likewise,
  fields are defined using the [...] operator, e.g. CPU_F_PgMode is CPU_F[7:6].

  To obtain the address of a register, use the unary & operator.


Known limitations
-----------------

This is a list of some known limitations and missing "must have" features.
There are certainly many more.

- "cycles" are one per instruction, not one per CPU cycle:
  Use shared/disasm.c:m8c_cycles

- simulation time is not synchronized with real time:
  Every X cycles (configurable), check against lower/upper bound (configurable)
  of deviation from real time. If running too fast, wait. If running too slow,
  cancel the time debt and proceed.

- relation of simulation and real time is not tracked:
  When checking time, record both times, then plot at post-simulation
  analysis.

- there are no traces for intructions executed:
  Instructions are easy, data will be harder. Do data "intelligently", by
  recording just the information an instruction has destroyed ?

- there are no traces for I/O lines:
  Actually, a little GUI may be nice for once. Also add a means to override
  target lines and provide script-driven or interactive stimuli.

- no handling of interrupts observed in the target:
  Poll INT_VC of target, clear any pending interrupts through INT_CLRx, then do
  further processing in the simulator.

- no generation of interrupts:
  Script should be able to post an interrupt, etc. To do: think one example
  through from A to Z, e.g., operation of shift registers in a serial link.

- implementation of "PC" should be nice and fast, but it's not really
  convenient for checks against boundaries:
  We don't catch wrap-arounds at 0xffff, at ROM end, or the extra cycle when
  crossing an 8 bit boundary.

- scripting language doesn't really know whether it wants to be interactive or
  non-interactive:
  Yeah, those decisions ... Note that CPP isn't suitable for interactive use.

- should the name of the PC be "PC" (it's a register) or "." (like in the
  assembler) ?
  Or both ?

- no access to symbols:
  Of course, since our assembler doesn't output them, we can't use them.

- no way to interactively halt the problem:
  Should catch SIGINT, and do something like a HALT.

- no breakpoints:
  Use HALT. Then figure out what to do with multiple breakpoints. Just report,
  dump data (not needed if we have an infinite trace buffer with full
  playback), and proceed ?

- weak scripting language:
  No loops, no variables, no functions. Should I just drag over the whole
  umlsim core, any never worry again about a lack of power ?

- no quick interconnect overview:
  should support graphical (Postscript/XFig or interactive) view of
  configuration status of interconnect

- GPIO isn't just binary:
  We should be able to drive a pin with a pull up/down, which doesn't override
  a strong output. We should be able to drive a pin with Z. The simulator
  should (optionally) detect conflicts, i.e., Z vs. Z on input, strong H vs.
  strong L, and resistive H vs. resisitive L.

- drive vs. ICE priority is wrong:
  It should be possible to override input from the ICE, and just use the ICE
  for output.

- simulated drive is not seen by target:
  So we can't just feed synthetic data to a digital block.

- register definitions should be shared with assembler:
  Move them to shared/ or similar. Also consider giving them a more specific
  name, and to hide registers missing in specific chips.

- is it really a good idea to make FOO to the access ?
  If it's reg[FOO] in the assembler, it should also be reg[FOO] and not just
  FOO in the simulator, no ?

- assignments should also allow bit fields:
  "PRT0DM2[0] = 1" just makes so much sense ...

- consider supporting read-modify-write operators:
  "PRT0DR ^= 0xff", anyone ?
