Components
==========

U1		74HC04 or similar (see below)
D1-D5		5 generic small signal diodes, e.g., 1N4148
C1, C2		2 100 nF, ceramic, any tolerance
R1-R6		6 100 Ohm, any tolerance
CONN1		DB25 connector, male
CONN2		100 mil header, 5 pins

If only 5V operation is desired, a 74HCT04 can be used as well.
A 74HC14 may yield better noise tolerance.
