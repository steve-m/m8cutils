This is a very basic big-banging programmer for CY8C2xxxx chips. It
connects to the parallel (printer) port. It operates at 3V and 5V.

The control software for it is in the directory ../prog


The circuit
-----------

This circuit is loosely based on the CYP-Type3 programmer by
Ajith S., see

A self-powered target can operate at 3V and at 5V. In 3V mode, a
current of up to about 20 mA may flow into the target on XRES,
and of 15 mA each on SDATA and SCLK.

The schematic was produced with gschem from the gEDA project, see
http://www.geda.seul.org/


The layout
----------

It just uses the non-SMT components I had at hand. All of them are
extremely common.

The layout was produced with PCB, see http://pcb.sourceforge.net/
