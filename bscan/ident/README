This directory contains a number of environments that are used, in
conjunction with ../models.m8cbscan, to try to identify various
components attached to a test target.

The script "all" executes all these models, and reports whether
they are congruous with the measured behaviour or not.

Note that some of the false positives could be avoided by forcing
m8cbscan to also try configurations where strong drives are expected
to collide (e.g., "1" into GND). Also note that such collisions can
happen during regular testing, if the model and the actual circuit
differ.
