reginfo
-------

Usage: reginfo register [value]

"reginfo" pretty-prints the fields of the specified register. If a value
is given, it also prints the corresponding field contents. The name can
be given in numeric or symbolic form. Values are printed in symbolic
form, if available. If a field has named values, but the specified value
does not match any of them, it is printed as a number in parentheses.

Example: ./reginfo DEC_CR0 0x50

reginfo is mainly intended as a demonstration for the use of the
register definitions database.
