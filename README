This is a collection of utilities for programming the Cypress
CY8C2xxxx series of microcontrollers, see
http://www.cypress.com/psoc


This collection consists of the following parts:

  dasm/
    A disassembler for the M8C language

  prog/
    A programmer, with drivers for different types of programmer
    hardware

  waspic/
    A simple PIC-based programmer that communicates via RS-232C

  shared/
    Code shared among programs of this project


Installation
------------

Just type "make". If you don't have gputils installed, the build
will eventually fail in waspic/. If your version of gcc doesn't
agree with the CFLAGS, edit them in Common.make.

There is no "make install" yet. The resulting executables are:

- programmer (host side): prog/cy8c2prog
- disassembler: dasm/m8cdasm
- programmer (firmware): waspic/waspic.hex


Testing
-------

Once everything is built, you can run the regression tests with
"make test" from the top-level directory (i.e., this one). They
can also be run individually per component, by running "make
test" in the respective directory.
