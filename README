Overview
--------

This is a collection of utilities for programming the Cypress(r) M8C
family of microcontrollers, and in particular the PSoC(tm) (CY8C2xxxx)
series, see http://www.cypress.com/psoc


This collection consists of the following parts:

  as/
    An assembler for the M8C assembly language

  das/
    A disassembler for the M8C assembly language

  sim/
    A simulator for some M8C CPU features (very experimental)

  prog/
    A programmer, with drivers for different types of programmer
    hardware

  shared/
    Code shared among programs of this project

  connchk/
    Static ISSP-based connection checker (experimental)

  misc/
    Miscellaneous utilities and example programs

The home page of this package is at 
http://m8cutils.sourceforge.net/

Hardware designs for some of the programmers supported by
"m8cprog" are distributed in the m8cprogs package that can also
be found at
http://m8cutils.sourceforge.net/


Installation
------------

If you wish to install the utilities in a location different from
/usr, edit INSTALL_PREFIX in Config.make.

Then just type "make". If your version of gcc doesn't agree with
the CFLAGS, edit them in Common.make.

The resulting executables are:

- assembler: as/m8cas
- disassembler: das/m8cdas
- simulator: sim/m8csim
- programmer (host side): prog/m8cprog

You can now run the regression tests with "make test". If satisfied
with the outcome, install everything with "make install". Note that
the utilities won't be able to find their support files by default,
unless you install them.

By default, "make" output is terse, making it easy to see what is
done, but now showing how. You can enable full output, e.g., to
debug build problems, by putting V=1 on the command line when
invoking "make", e.g.,
% make V=1 all


Uninstallation
--------------

"make uninstall" will remove all files installed and also the
directories created underneath $(INSTALL_PREFIX)/share


Testing
-------

Once everything is built, you can run the regression tests with
"make test" from the top-level directory (i.e., this one). They
can also be run individually per component, by running "make
test" in the respective directory.
