Components
==========

U1		74HC04 or similar(see below)
D1		generic small signal diode, e.g., 1N4148
C1		100 nF, ceramic, any tolerance
R1, R2, R3	10k, any tolerance
R4, R5, R7	100 Ohm, any tolerance
R6		1k, any tolerance
CONN1		DB9 connector, female
CONN2		100 mil header, 5 pins

If only 5V operation is desired (which is all that works at the
moment anyway), a 74HCT04 can be used as well. A 74HC14 may yield
better noise tolerance.
