The files containing hardware schematics or layouts of this project
are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
version 2 (GPLv2), with the following clarifications and additions:

1) The term "source code" refers to the file format used by gschem
   or PCB, respectively.

2) The term "binary" refers to

   a) any representation that does not correspond to one of the
      formats listed under clause 1) of this file, or

   b) any reproduction that is not a digital copy.

   In particular, this means that you have to comply with Section 3)
   of the GPLv2 if you distribute

   a) copies converted a different format, e.g., one used by
      different design tools, or

   b) a board produced from a layout provided in this package, be
      it in the form of the board alone, a kit, or a completely
      built circuit.

3) Clauses 1 through 4 of these clarifications and additions form an
   integral part of the license and must be reproduced whenever the
   GPLv2 obliges you to reproduce the "License".

4) If any of the three points above conflicts with the GPLv2, the
   GPLv2 takes priority.

A comment on clause 2a: this clause is primarily intended to prevent
redistribution solely in proprietary formats, or formats only
recognized by proprietary tools. If you wish to distribute a version
converted to the native format of another free tool, and this version
retains all relevant information contained in the original, an
exception from clause 2a may be granted on request.
