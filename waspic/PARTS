Components
==========

U1		PIC16LF88, or similar (see below)
Q1, Q2		Generic NPN transistor, e.g. BC337
R1, R2		1k, any tolerance
R3, R4		10k, any tolerance
R5, R6, R7	100 Ohm, any tolerance
CONN1		100 mil header, 5 pins
CONN2		DB9 connector, female

If low-voltage operation (down to 2V) is desired, use a 16LF87 or
16LF88. Otherwise (4V or more), a 16F87 or 16F88 will do, too.
The programmer uses no special features but the UART, so it
should be possible to build an equivalent circuit with other
PICs, e.g. a 16F688 (which is smaller, cheaper, and also works
with 2V - and just happens to be missing in my junkyard).
