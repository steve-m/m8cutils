cy8c2utils "to do" list
======================

cy8c2prog
---------

- support selection of reset vs. power-on mode
- check bit-banging code
- query terminal settings to determine terminal width (OUTPUT_WIDTH)
- add terminal control helper functions to tty.c (for bit-banging)
- add real-time support and deadline measurements (for bit-banging)
- add support for the remaining current (and obsolete ?) chip models
- generalize interface device support to USB, etc.
- check that the Intel hex format is properly implemented
- don't require voltage if we're reading and the target supplies power
- validate vectors against "official" vectors (?)
- add regression tests
- validate the silicon revision procedure

waspic
------

- add protective resistors to SDATA, SCLK, and XRES
- check the checksum in communication with the host
- add a voltage reference and measure VDD
- add possibility to provide power to the target

share/file
----------

- include line number and file name in diagnostics
- add file output regression tests

m8cdasm
-------

- regression tests need to check file input error handling
