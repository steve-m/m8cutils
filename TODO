======================

cy8c2prog
---------

- support selection of reset vs. power-on mode
- check bit-banging code
- query terminal settings to determine terminal width (OUTPUT_WIDTH)
- don't pile up all the "intelligence" at the bottom of cy8c2prog.c
- add terminal control helper functions to tty.c (for bit-banging)
- add real-time support and deadline measurements (for bit-banging)
- add support for the remaining current (and obsolete ?) chip models
- generalize interface device support to USB, etc.
- check that the Intel hex format is properly implemented
- don't require voltage if we're reading and the target supplies power
- validate vectors against "official" vectors (?)
- add regression tests
